"""Read-only price-integrity checks for research backtests.

The detector in this module deliberately does not repair prices or infer an
adjustment factor.  A large discontinuity can be caused by a split, par-value
change, capital reduction, bad source row, or a genuine no-limit session.  In
all of those cases an unadjusted-price backtest should stop and require an
auditable adjusted/PIT data source instead of guessing.

# larger discontinuities produced by splits and other corporate actions.

# This threshold governs *visibility in the audit report only*.  It is not, and
# cannot be, the protection itself: an ordinary cash-dividend ex-date gap in
# Taiwan is roughly 3-5%, which sits inside the +/-10% daily limit band and is
# therefore indistinguishable from a genuine price move in OHLC-only data.

    The decision depends on the *dataset*, never on the audit result.  ``audit``
    is accepted for call-site symmetry and reporting, and is deliberately not
    consulted here.

    Why the audit must not gate this
    --------------------------------
    An earlier version returned ``unadjusted and not audit.empty``, i.e. it
    treated "the threshold scan found nothing" as evidence that unadjusted
    prices were of adjusted quality.  That inference is invalid.  The scan can
    only see discontinuities larger than the threshold, and the threshold cannot
    go below the +/-10% daily limit without flagging genuine moves.  Ordinary
    ex-dividend and ex-rights gaps are smaller than that, so they are structurally
    invisible to it -- an empty audit is equally consistent with clean data and
    with a history full of sub-threshold corporate actions.

    Measured on the cached top100 universe: the audit flags 34 rows across 11
    stocks at the 11% threshold, so the gate happens to fire.  Drop those 11
    stocks and the audit is empty for the remaining 89 -- under the old rule the
    backtest proceeded as if their prices were clean, while those 89 carry 1716
    overnight gaps in the 3-10% band where corporate actions are unrecoverable
    from OHLC alone.

    Distinguishing a dividend gap from a real move needs corporate-action data
    this repo does not have.  Until it does, the honest position is to refuse
    unadjusted histories outright and let the caller opt in explicitly
    (``SWING_ALLOW_UNADJUSTED=1``) for contaminated smoke tests.
